---

[OPENING SECTION - EMPATHY & PAIN]

If you're reading this, you're probably tired of losing listings to agents who charge less.

You show up prepared. You know your market. You deliver results.

But when the seller says "we'll let you know," you already know what happened.

They went with the 4% agent. Again.

And you're left wondering: "How do I compete without dropping my commission?"

Here's the truth most agents never figure out:

You're not losing on price. You're losing on POSITIONING.

The agents who consistently win premium listings aren't cheaper. They're not working harder. They're not more experienced.

They simply know how to position themselves so that price becomes irrelevant.

And over the next 90 days, I'm going to show you exactly how to do the same.

[THE COST OF STAYING STUCK]

Right now, being stuck in the "price wars" is costing you approximately $87,000 per year.

Here's the math:

Average realtor closing 12 deals/year at $7K average commission = $84,000
Top-tier realtor closing 30 deals/year at $9K average commission = $270,000

That's a $186,000 gap.

But let's be conservative. Let's say you just want to get to 20 deals at $8K average.

That's $160,000. A $76,000 increase from where you are now.

Every month you wait is $6,300 you're leaving on the table.

Not because you're not good enough.
But because you don't have the SYSTEM that premium agents use.

[THE SOLUTION]

Introducing: Elite Listing Mastery

The 12-week implementation program that teaches you the psychology, positioning, and proven systems behind winning 70%+ of your listing presentations—at full commission.

This isn't a "tips and tricks" course.

This is a complete operating system for how premium agents think, position, and present themselves to sellers.

HERE'S WHAT YOU GET:

MODULE 1: The Premium Positioning Foundation (Week 1-2)
Why sellers choose expensive agents over cheap ones—and how to trigger those exact psychological buying patterns in your market. Includes: the "Category of One" framework that eliminates 90% of competition before you even meet.

MODULE 2: The Pre-Listing Advantage (Week 3-4)
How to win the listing BEFORE the appointment through strategic pre-framing. You'll get: the 5-page "Authority Package" template, pre-appointment call scripts, and positioning sequences that make you the automatic favorite.

MODULE 3: The Psychology-Based Presentation (Week 5-7)
My complete listing presentation system with built-in psychological triggers. Includes: the "Trust Triangle" opening (5 minutes that eliminates price objections), the "Premium Justification Stack," and the "3-Path Close" that makes signing feel inevitable.

MODULE 4: The Objection Neutralization System (Week 8-9)
Word-for-word responses to the 12 most common objections including "your commission is too high," "we want to interview other agents," and "we're thinking about FSBO." Each script is designed to reframe rather than defend.

MODULE 5: The Follow-Up That Converts (Week 10-11)
What to do when they say "we need to think about it" (hint: you failed earlier, here's how to recover). Includes: the 7-day follow-up sequence that converts 40% of "maybes" into signed agreements.

MODULE 6: The Premium Agent Ecosystem (Week 12)
How to build a referral system that feeds you premium listings consistently. The exact positioning that makes past clients refer you to their affluent friends instead of discount agents.

[PROOF - CASE STUDIES]

"I was averaging 8 listings per year at 5.5% commission. After implementing the Pre-Listing Advantage and Psychology-Based Presentation, I closed 19 listings in 12 months at 6%. My income went from $78K to $143K."
— Jennifer Martinez, Phoenix, AZ

"The objection scripts alone were worth 10X the investment. I stopped losing listings to discount agents completely. My close rate went from 35% to 71%."  
— David Park, Austin, TX

"I thought I needed more leads. Turns out I just needed better positioning. Now I'm the agent sellers CALL instead of me chasing them."
— Sarah Williams, Denver, CO

[WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT]

Most real estate training teaches WHAT to say.

This program teaches WHY it works—so you can adapt it to any situation.

You'll understand:
→ The 6 psychological triggers that make sellers trust you instantly
→ Why premium pricing actually INCREASES conversion (when positioned correctly)  
→ How to use "strategic vulnerability" to build rapport faster than competitors

SUBJECT: I lost a $52K listing in 9 minutes  
PREVIEW: The mistake that cost me everything...

[First Name],

I still remember the address: 4782 Oakmont Drive.

Beautiful home. Motivated seller. Perfect listing.

I showed up with my presentation printed and bound. My comps were perfect. I had rehearsed.

9 minutes into my pitch, the seller interrupts:

"Thanks for coming by. We'll let you know."

I knew what that meant.

I walked to my car and sat there for 5 minutes thinking: "What just happened?"

That listing went to another agent. A 5% agent (I was at 6%).

The commission would've been $52,000.

But here's the thing I didn't understand then:

I didn't lose on price.

I lost because I was BORING.

I sounded like every other agent. Same comps. Same marketing pitch. Same "I'll work hard for you" speech.

The seller tuned out at minute 4. I just didn't notice.

Tomorrow I'm going to tell you what I SHOULD have done—and what I do NOW that wins me 7 out of 10 listings.

But today, I just want to ask:

How many listings have you lost because you were "the same as everyone else"?

Think about it.

Talk tomorrow,
[Coach Name]

P.S. On Friday I'm opening enrollment for something that specifically solves this problem. More details coming Thursday.

EMAIL 2: "The 7-minute framework" (Day 2, 10am)

SUBJECT: What I do in the first 7 minutes now
PREVIEW: (Everything changed after I learned this)

Hey [First Name],

Yesterday I told you about the $52K listing I lost because I was boring.

Today I want to show you what I learned from that disaster.

After I lost that listing, I became obsessed with a question:

"Why do sellers choose one agent over another when everyone has similar credentials?"

I studied psychology books. I interviewed sellers who recently chose agents. I analyzed what top producers were doing differently.

And I discovered something:

Listings aren't won during the presentation.

They're won in the FIRST 7 MINUTES.

Here's what I mean:

Most agents show up and immediately start talking about their marketing plan, their experience, their credentials.

BORING.

The seller's brain checks out. They smile politely. But they've already decided you're "generic agent #3."

What should you do instead?

You need to DISRUPT THE PATTERN.

Here's the framework I use now (I call it "The Hook + Human"):

MINUTE 1-3: The Hook (Pattern Interrupt)
Instead of launching into my pitch, I start with a story or a provocative question that forces them to actually THINK.

Example: "Before we start, can I ask: what's the #1 thing you're worried about with this sale?"

This does three things:
1. Shows you actually care about THEM (not just your commission)
2. Gives you intel on their hot buttons
3. Breaks the "agent script" pattern they're expecting

MINUTE 4-7: The Human (Authenticity)
I share a brief personal story that builds trust and shows I'm a real person, not a sales robot.

Example: "I get it. When I sold my first home, I chose the wrong agent and it cost me $18K. That's why I'm obsessed with making sure my sellers get top dollar."

Now I'm not just "another agent." I'm someone who GETS them.

Only AFTER this do I start my actual presentation.

And by then? They're already leaning toward me.

Tomorrow I'll show you the #1 objection this framework triggers—and exactly how to handle it.

Stay tuned,
[Coach Name]

P.S. This framework is just ONE of 17 presentation strategies I cover in the new mini-course I'm launching Friday. If you're tired of losing listings, you'll want to see this.

EMAIL 3: "'Your commission is too high'" (Day 3, 9am)

SUBJECT: "Your commission is too high"  
PREVIEW: Here's what I say now (word-for-word)

[First Name],

If you've been using the "Hook + Human" opening I shared yesterday, you're probably seeing better engagement from sellers.

But you'll still hear this:

"Your commission seems high."

Most agents panic. They start defending. They start justifying their marketing spend and their "value."

Bad move.

Here's what I say instead:

"I appreciate you bringing that up directly. Can I ask—what's more important to you: saving 1% on commission, or netting $25,000 more on your sale price?"

[Pause. Let them answer.]

"Because here's what I've seen over and over: Discount agents aren't discount because they're generous. They're discount because they CAN'T command full price. And sellers who choose them almost always leave money on the table."

Then I pull up my phone and show them a simple comparison:

Home A: Listed with 4% agent, sold for $387K after 71 days  
Home B (similar): Listed with me at 6%, sold for $421K in 22 days

"That seller saved $7,800 in commission but lost $34,000 in sale price. Net loss: $26,200. Would you make that trade?"

[Pause.]

"I didn't think so."

End of objection.

Here's why this works:

1. You didn't defend—you REFRAMED
2. You used specific numbers (not vague claims)
3. You made choosing cheap feel RISKY instead of smart

Try this on your next appointment and watch what happens.

Tomorrow: The sneaky way sellers test you (and how to pass every time).

EMAIL 4: "Launching: Listing Presentation Mastery" (Day 4, 9am)

SUBJECT: [NEW] Listing Presentation Mastery (enrollment opens today)
PREVIEW: Everything you need to win 7/10 listings at full commission

Hey [First Name],

For the past 3 days I've been sharing frameworks and scripts that transformed how I win listings.

Today, I'm making all of it available in one place.

Introducing: Listing Presentation Mastery

A focused mini-course (2.5 hours of training) that gives you the complete system for winning more listings at full commission.

HERE'S WHAT YOU GET:

Module 1: The Psychology of Seller Decision-Making (22 min)
Why sellers really choose one agent over another (hint: it's not marketing or credentials). You'll learn the 4 psychological triggers that control every listing decision.

Module 2: The "Hook + Human" Framework (31 min)  
The exact 7-minute opening I use to break the "generic agent" pattern and build instant trust. Includes: 12 different "hook" examples you can customize for your personality.

Module 3: The Premium Justification Stack (38 min)
How to position your commission as the smart choice (not the expensive one). You'll get: the comparison framework, the "net proceeds" calculator, and 5 case studies you can show sellers.

Module 4: Objection Neutralization Scripts (44 min)
Word-for-word responses to 15 common objections including commission pushback, FSBO considerations, and "we're interviewing others." Each script is designed to reframe, not defend.

Module 5: The Close That Doesn't Feel Like a Close (27 min)
My 3-option close that makes signing feel like the natural next step (not a high-pressure decision). Plus: what to do when they say "we need to think about it."

BONUS MATERIALS:
→ Complete presentation slide deck template (Google Slides + Canva)
→ 47-page script library (printable PDF)
→ "Pre-listing package" template (send 24 hours before appointment)
→ Follow-up email sequence for "thinking about it" prospects
→ Private access to monthly Q&A calls for course members

Regular price: $497
EARLY BIRD (next 48 hours): $397

Plus if you enroll in the next 48 hours, you get:
🎁 Bonus #1: "Luxury Listing Mastery" module ($97 value)
🎁 Bonus #2: 15-minute presentation review with me ($150 value)
🎁 Bonus #3: "Seller objection cheat sheet" laminated card ($27 value)

[BUTTON: Enroll for $397 (Save $100)]

GUARANTEE: Complete the course, use it on 3 listing appointments, and if you don't win at least ONE listing you wouldn't have otherwise, I'll refund you + send you $50 for wasting your time.

Here's what past students are saying:

"I closed 2 listings in my first week after finishing the course. The psychology module alone was worth 10X what I paid."
— Marcus T., Denver

"Finally, a training that's actually TACTICAL. No fluff. Just scripts and frameworks I could use immediately."
— Sarah K., Phoenix

"My close rate went from 40% to 68% in 60 days. This course paid for itself after ONE listing."
— Jennifer L., Austin

Only 150 enrollment spots available (keeping it small for the monthly Q&A calls).

Current enrollment: 73/150

Next availability: 4 months from now

[BUTTON: Enroll Now for $397]

To your listing success,
[Coach Name]

P.S. Remember: ONE extra listing at $8K commission = 20X return on this $397 investment. The question isn't "can I afford this?" It's "can I afford NOT to fix my listing presentation?"

---

EMAIL 5: "Final call (bonuses disappear tonight)" (Day 5, 6pm)

SUBJECT: Bonuses disappear at midnight (last call)
PREVIEW: Early bird pricing + $274 in bonuses end in 6 hours

[First Name],

This is it.

Early bird pricing for Listing Presentation Mastery ends at midnight tonight.

After 11:59pm PT:
→ Price increases from $397 to $497
→ The 3 bonuses worth $274 disappear
→ Next enrollment isn't for 4 months

That's a $374 difference.

Here's the question:

Is learning how to win 7 out of 10 listings worth $397?

Because if you close just ONE extra listing this year using what you learn, you'll 20X your investment.

If you close TWO extra listings? You'll 40X it.

And if you become the agent who consistently wins listings while your competitors struggle?

Priceless.

38 spots left. 6 hours until price increase.

[BUTTON: Enroll for $397 (Before Midnight)]

Still on the fence? Remember the guarantee:

Use the system on 3 appointments. If you don't win at least ONE listing you wouldn't have otherwise, I'll refund you + give you $50.

You literally cannot lose here.

The only risk is staying where you are—losing listings to agents who aren't as good as you.

Decision time.

[Coach Name]

P.S. "I almost didn't buy this because of the price. Best $397 I ever spent. Closed 3 listings in 45 days using the exact scripts. My only regret is not buying sooner." — David P., Seattle`

WHY THESE SCRIPTS WORK:

Most "real estate scripts" sound robotic and fake.

These are different.

They're based on psychology and natural conversation patterns. They sound like YOU, just more strategic.

You'll learn:
→ How to handle commission objections without dropping your rate
→ What to say when sellers say "we're interviewing 3 other agents"  
→ The exact words top producers use to pre-frame listing appointments
→ How to ask for referrals without feeling awkward or salesy
→ The follow-up language that converts 30% of "maybes" into clients

These scripts have been tested by thousands of agents across every market type: hot markets, cold markets, competitive markets, slow markets.

They work because they're built on what actually makes sellers say yes.

Quick tip for getting the most out of this:

Don't just read them and file them away.

PICK ONE SCRIPT. Memorize it. Use it TODAY.

If I had to recommend just one to start with, it's Script #7: The Commission Justification Response.

This single script has saved more deals than any other. Here's why:

When a seller says "your commission seems high," most agents panic and start defending themselves.

This script completely reframes the conversation so price becomes irrelevant.

I actually recorded myself using this exact script in a real listing appointment last month.

EMAIL 2: "The script most agents won't use" (Sent Day 2, 10am)

SUBJECT: The script most agents are too scared to use
PREVIEW: (But it works better than anything else)

[First Name],

Yesterday I sent you the 27 Scripts guide.

Today I want to share the script I left OUT of the guide.

Why did I leave it out?

Because it's controversial. It makes agents uncomfortable. And most won't use it even though it works incredibly well.

I call it: "The Honesty Bomb"

Here's how it works:

You're on a listing appointment. You can sense the seller is skeptical, guarded, comparing you to other agents.

Most agents try to "sell harder." They talk more about their marketing, their credentials, their track record.

Bad move.

Instead, you say this:

"Can I be honest with you? You're probably interviewing 2-3 other agents. And we're all going to tell you similar things: we'll market your home, we'll get you top dollar, we'll work hard for you. Right?"

[Pause. They nod.]

"So here's what I'd recommend: Don't choose an agent based on who has the best pitch. Choose based on who you actually TRUST. Because when things get hard during this sale—and they will—trust is the only thing that matters. So my question is: do you trust me?"

[Pause. Let them sit with it.]

Now you're not competing on marketing or credentials.

You're competing on gut feeling. And if you've built rapport up to this point, you win.

Why does this work?

1. It's disarmingly honest (breaks the "salesy agent" pattern)
2. It reframes the criteria from logical to emotional  
3. It forces them to consciously evaluate how they FEEL about you
4. It positions you as confident (you're not afraid to be direct)

The first time I used this, I was terrified.

The seller sat there for 10 seconds (felt like 10 minutes) and then said:

"You know what? I do trust you. Let's do this."

Signed the listing that afternoon.

Now, I'm not saying you should use this on every appointment.

But when you sense the seller is overthinking, over-comparing, stuck in "analysis paralysis"?

This script cuts through all of it.

Try it. Let me know what happens.

Tomorrow: The #1 follow-up mistake that costs agents listings (and the 3-step sequence that fixes it).

EMAIL 3: "Why they said 'we'll think about it'" (Sent Day 3, 9am)

SUBJECT: Why they said "we'll think about it"  
PREVIEW: (And what to do about it)

[First Name],

You just finished a listing appointment.

You thought it went well. Good conversation. They seemed interested.

Then at the end, they hit you with:

"Thanks for coming by. We need to think about it. We'll let you know."

Your heart sinks.

You know what that means: you lost.

But here's what most agents don't realize:

When a seller says "we need to think about it," it doesn't mean they need more TIME.

It means you didn't give them a reason to choose YOU.

Let me explain.

Sellers say "we'll think about it" for 3 reasons:

REASON 1: You didn't differentiate yourself from other agents  
They see you as "generic agent #2" and need to compare you to everyone else.

REASON 2: You didn't handle their hidden objection  
They have a concern they didn't voice (usually about commission, marketing, or trust).

REASON 3: You didn't ask for the listing directly  
You were afraid to "be pushy" so you left the decision unclear.

Here's the good news:

You can fix all 3 of these with a simple follow-up sequence.

Here's what I do:

STEP 1: The Same-Day Text (within 2 hours)
"Hey [Name], thanks for having me today. I know you're considering your options. Quick question: on a scale of 1-10, how close are you to making a decision? Just want to gauge where you're at."

This does two things:
1. Keeps you top of mind
2. Gives you intel on how serious they are

STEP 2: The Next-Day Email (24 hours later)
Subject: "One thing I forgot to mention..."

Body:
"Hi [Name],

I was thinking about our conversation yesterday and realized I forgot to mention one thing that might matter to you:

[Share ONE specific insight about their property or situation that shows you were paying attention]

Anyway, I know you're weighing your options. If any questions come up, I'm here.

[Your name]"

This positions you as thoughtful (not desperate) and keeps the door open.

STEP 3: The 3-Day Call (72 hours later)
"Hi [Name], it's [Your name]. I know you're probably still weighing your options. I don't want to be pushy, but I do want to ask: is there anything holding you back from moving forward? Because if there's a concern I can address, I'd love the chance to do that."

[Listen. Let them talk.]

If they give you an objection, handle it directly.
If they don't have a specific concern, you say:

"Here's what I'd recommend: Let's get the paperwork signed and get your home on the market this week. If at any point in the first 30 days you're not happy with how things are going, you can fire me. Fair enough?"

This removes risk and forces a decision.

WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:

Using this 3-step sequence, I convert about 35% of "we'll think about it" responses into signed listings.

That means if you get 10 "maybes" per year, this sequence could give you 3-4 extra listings.

At $8K average commission, that's $24K-$32K more income.

From a simple follow-up system.

Most agents never follow up at all (or they send a generic "just checking in" text that goes nowhere).

Don't be most agents.

Use this sequence. Win more listings.

    headline: "I Help Real Estate Coaches Turn Their Knowledge Into Revenue",
    subheadline: "Conversion-focused copywriting for realtors who teach realtors",
    story: `I'm a direct response copywriter specializing in the real estate education space.

While I'm early in my career (no client work yet), I've spent 18+ months studying the psychology of what makes realtors buy training, the objections that stop them, and the positioning that breaks through.

I've consumed hundreds of real estate coach sales pages, email sequences, and webinars. I've analyzed what works (and what doesn't). And I've reverse-engineered the patterns that consistently produce results.

My approach is simple:

1. **I understand your audience deeply** - Realtors are skeptical of "gurus" and tired of theory-heavy training. They want tactical, immediately usable systems that justify the investment.

2. **I write for conversion, not creativity** - Every word has a job: to move the prospect closer to the sale while building trust and positioning you as the clear authority.

3. **I focus on transformation, not information** - Your prospects don't want to "learn about" listing presentations. They want to WIN more listings. My copy sells the outcome, not the curriculum.`,
    whyRealEstateCoaches: `**Why I chose to specialize in real estate coaching:**

The real estate education space is unique. You're not selling to consumers—you're selling to business owners (agents) who are investing in their own growth.

This means:
- They evaluate ROI ruthlessly (your copy must show clear path to 10X+ returns)
- They're comparison shoppers (your positioning must differentiate clearly)
- They're time-starved (your copy must respect their time and get to the point)
- They're skeptical (your proof must be specific, credible, and abundant)

I love this challenge. Real estate coaching copy requires both empathy (understanding agent frustrations) and strategic thinking (architecting the buyer journey).

Plus, the metrics are clear: more enrollments = more revenue for you = proof my copy works.`
